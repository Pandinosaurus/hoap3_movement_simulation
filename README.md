# HOAP-3 movement simulation in OpenRAVE

This is the code to simulate different movement algorithms of the humanoid robot HOAP-3. The simulator is [OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/). It was developed during my [PhD thesis](http://miguelgfierro.com/docs/gonzalez-fierro2014thesis.pdf). 

Folder "Models" contains the CAD models for the robot and the environment.

Folder "head_robot_path_planning" contains a simulation of a path planning algorithm called Bidirectional Random Rapidly-Exploring Trees ([Bi-RRT](http://people.csail.mit.edu/aperez/obirrt/)).

Folder "hoap_navigation" contains a simulation of a biped walking algorithm called [Cart-Table](https://staff.aist.go.jp/kensuke.harada/papers/2003-ICRA%28KKKFHYH%29.pdf). It is one of the most used methods for walking generation in humanoids.

Folder "videos" contains different videos of the experiments.
